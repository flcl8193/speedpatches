# Speed patches
A collection of patches to increase the performance of PS2, GC, WII games on PCSX2, AetherSX2 and Dolphin emulators.

The main idea of this project is to make impossible-to-pass games for PC and Android completely passable with a smooth and stable gameplay.

Plans:
    
    [!] Ratchet & Clank 1
    
    [p] Ratchet & Clank 2
    
    [p] Ratchet & Clank 3
    
    [?] Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria
    
    [?] Xenosaga Episode III: Also sprach Zarathustra
    
    [?] Xenoblade Chronicles
    
    [?] The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess
    
    [?] Metroid Prime
    
    [?] Metroid Prime 2: Echoes
    
    [?] Metroid Prime 3: Corruption

Symbols:

    ok - (successfully) the patch is complete and works as expected.
    
    ! - (seriously) serious problems in the creation of the patch.
    
    p - (partially) the patch works, but does not apply to all functions of the game
    
    ? - (unknown) work on the creation has not yet begun

The list will be updated and patches too.
